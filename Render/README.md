# Graphics Coursework: Blender Render
## Overview

We spent some time learning blender and messing about before starting work on the actual project. We tended to work in meetings and quite quickly set out a plan and split our projects into the different models we would be developing.

## Objects and Components

The project consists of several distinct 3D objects that make up the pirate ship diorama:

- Ship Deck (Front Section) – Showcasing the open cannon deck below.
- Ship Back (Rear Section) – The back portion of the ship, aka the captains area.
- Mast and Sails – Central vertical structure with supporting beams and rigging.
- Cannons – Multiple cannons visible from the cutaway section and the cannon windows.
- Steering Wheel – Positioned on the upper deck near the back.

Each of these objects was modeled individually, then assembled together into a single composition for the final render however many of these were adapted once in the combined file and some were needed for measurements and reference in other files.

## Workflow and Process

Initial Modeling
- Each group member worked on separate objects. We frequently used the combined Blender file for consistent scaling, positioning, and visual reference.

Texturing and Materials
- After completing each of our basic models, we moved on to texturing and setting materials some of these were finalized within the main Blender file to ensure consistency.

Integration and Composition
- Once all objects were combined, we collaborated to make final adjustments to the models, materials, and added lighting so that the entire diorama looked visually cohesive and well-balanced.

Rendering
The final scene was rendered to produce a polished, game-style image that captures the atmosphere of a pirate ship environment.


## Collaboration

Our team collaborated throughout all stages of the project:
Design: Agreed on the pirate ship theme and created an initial concept sketch.
Modeling: Divided work among team members while maintaining scale and proportions.
Texturing and Integration: Combined all assets into one scene and refined it collaboratively.
Final Render: Adjusted lighting, composition, and materials as a group to achieve a high-quality final output.
