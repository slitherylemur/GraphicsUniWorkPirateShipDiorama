# Graphics Coursework: Pirate Ship Diorama
## Overview

Our chosen theme was a pirate ship, designed and presented as a diorama-style scene with the concept being as a promotional render for a video game featuring pirate ships.
The final scene includes multiple 3D objects that we modeled, textured, and arranged together to form a cohesive and visually appealing composition.

## inspiration

We all like the pirates of the carabean movies and 2 of us play the game Sea of Thieves. One of us is currently working on his own ship related game and together we all decided that a Pirate ship could be a fun theme for a 3d diorama with many different pathways we could choose from.

## Concept and Design

During our first group meeting, we developed our original sketch that served as the foundation for our 3D scene.
This sketch can be seen in the Render folder plan.jpeg.
Our main creative decision was to cut off the front of the pirate ship, exposing the cannon deck below. This allowed us to have a view of the cannons we wanted to make and show more detail aswell as having the ability for the entire ship to fit in a frame with the orthographic style camera angle in our references of previouse year projects.
We had a few other ideas but felt that this plan was perfect to be able to visualise all the different objects we listed we would want to create.
We wanted to capture a video game aesthetic rather than aiming for complete realism.
We used variouse concept images for different parts of the ship and these references have been added into the folders within the render section.
